Question and answer site
========================

Description: This app was an exercise to practice using the has_and_belongs_to_many association to link two models to each other, questions and users. The app is now ready to track which users contributed to each question as well as which questions were answered by each user. 

So far, the user is only able to see the contributors for each question, but as a further exercise I may go back to enable the user to see which questions were answered by each user.

Note: This page was very useful in helping me figure out how to list the names from the user class. Thanks to Bradley Priest: http://bradleypriest.com/2012/03/18/accessing-attributes-from-has-many-through-join-models/
